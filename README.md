## üìñ Abstract  

Multiplication is a critical operation in **Digital Signal Processing (DSP) systems**.  
This project implements a **high-speed 8-bit Vedic Multiplier** using the **Urdhva Tiryagbhyam algorithm** from Vedic mathematics, optimized with a **Brent Kung Adder (BKA)** for fast carry computation.  

‚úÖ Reduced **delay, complexity, and area** compared to Array, Dadda, Wallace, and Ripple-Carry-based multipliers.  
‚úÖ Designed in **Verilog HDL** and simulated on **Xilinx Vivado 14.7**.  
‚úÖ Outperforms existing multipliers in **speed and efficiency**.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture  

- Uses **Urdhva Tiryagbhyam sutra** for multiplication.  
- Employs **Brent Kung Parallel Prefix Adders** to reduce propagation delay.  
- Structure:  
  - Four 4-bit Vedic Multipliers  
  - Two 8-bit BKAs + One 4-bit BKA  
  - AND + OR gates for partial products combination  

üìä **Comparison with Other Multipliers:**  

| Multiplier              | Logic Levels | Delay (ns) |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------|
| Array Multiplier         | 19           | 12.934     |
| Dadda Multiplier         | 16           | 9.745      |
| Wallace Tree Multiplier  | 12           | 7.815      |
| Existed Vedic Multiplier | 15           | 9.130      |
| **Proposed (This Work)** | **13**       | **7.762**  |
